""" Classes for representing and creating a logical netlist in python,
along with reading and writing the logical netlist format.

Useful starting points:

 Cell - class to define and inspect a logical netlist cell.
 Library - A collection of cells.  All cells will must be part of a library
           to be within the logical netlist format.
 LogicalNetlist - class that can read and write logical netlist format, and
